Hello! We're excited to officially introduce the **Polkadot community in Uruguay**.

## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a multi-chain blockchain protocol that enables different blockchains to communicate with each other securely and in a decentralized manner. Designed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot is revolutionizing how we think about blockchain interoperability.
